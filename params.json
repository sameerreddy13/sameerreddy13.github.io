I love to learn and am most interested by computer science, statistics, math and the intersection of these fields. I've developed a few projects with what I've learned, so learn more about them below. \r\n\r\n##My Projects\r\n\r\n\r\n####Hurt Alert\r\nHurt Alert was a web application developed as a team, built with Python and Flask. It utilizes Berkeley crime data to present analytics and visualize this data in a heat map. More importantly it uses this data to route from point A to point B; finding the safest route to avoid areas of higher crime rates. Check out the [application](http://hurtalert.us-west-1.elasticbeanstalk.com) and [repository](https://github.com/kunaljaydesai/hurtalert)\r\n\r\n####Text Editor\r\nA text editor application built in Java with all basic features of a common text editor. Check out the [repository](https://github.com/sameerreddy13/TextEditor).\r\n\r\n####Bear Maps\r\nA mapping application for Berkeley built in Java as part of a university course. Generates a map of Berkeley with map navigation and shortest path routing from any two locations on the map.\r\n\r\n##Contact\r\n[Github](https://github.com/sameerreddy13),\r\n[Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sameerreddy13),\r\n[Email](sameer.reddy@berkeley.edu)",
